# Felipe Veas

**Site Reliability Engineer** | **Platform Reliability & Operations**

I operate and improve production Kubernetes platforms on GCP and AWS.  
My work focuses on reliability engineering, operational safety, and reducing
engineering toil through platform design, automation, and internal tooling.

~9 years operating distributed production systems and critical SaaS environments.

## Key Experience

- Production on-call rotations for critical services
- Incident response coordination and root-cause analysis
- GitOps deployment platforms (ArgoCD)
- Observability systems (metrics, logs, alerting)
- Kubernetes platform operations (GKE)
- Infrastructure as Code environments (Terraform)
- Automation and internal operational tooling

---

## Featured Project — Kubernetes Platform (GitOps + Terraform)

Repository:  
<https://github.com/felipe-veas/homelab-platform>

Production-style Kubernetes platform designed and operated using Terraform
for cluster bootstrap and ArgoCD for workload orchestration.

### Platform Capabilities

- App-of-apps GitOps deployment model
- Declarative workload delivery
- Observability stack (metrics + logs)
- Policy enforcement with Kyverno
- Ingress, certificates, and operational services

### Operational Impact

- Reproducible cluster bootstrap
- Safer change management
- Configuration drift detection
- Clear separation: infrastructure vs workloads
- Operational visibility of cluster state

---

## Automation & Tooling

I build tooling to reduce recurring operational work and allow engineers to
operate systems safely without deep infrastructure expertise.

**Examples**:

dotctl — internal operational CLI  
<https://github.com/felipe-veas/dotctl>

homebrew-tap — standardized tool distribution  
<https://github.com/felipe-veas/homebrew-tap>

**Outcomes**:

- Faster onboarding
- Standardized operational workflows
- Reduced configuration errors
- Less manual intervention during incidents

## Reliability & Operations

### Incident Response

- On-call incident handling and coordination
- Root-cause analysis and recurrence prevention
- Blameless post-incident reviews
- Recovery and service continuity procedures

### Reliability Engineering

- SLO-driven alerting
- Signal tuning and alert fatigue reduction
- Failure mode analysis
- Improving recovery characteristics (not only uptime)

### Platform Engineering

- Kubernetes workload standardization
- GitOps rollout patterns
- Safe deployment practices
- Developer enablement workflows

---

## Observability

Built and operated observability layers combining metrics, logs, and traces.

- Prometheus & Grafana
- Elastic Stack
- Datadog
- Alerting and signal quality tuning
- Faster incident triage and investigation

---

## Technical Stack

**Cloud & Infrastructure**  
GCP, AWS, Terraform, Linux

**Containers & Orchestration**  
Kubernetes (GKE), Helm, Docker

**GitOps & CI/CD**  
ArgoCD, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions

**Languages**  
Python, Bash, Go (tooling)

---

## Operational Background

- Multi-tenant high-availability systems
- Incident coordination
- Service recovery
- Capacity and scaling events
- Collaboration with development and product teams

---

## Engineering Approach

I focus on changing how systems are operated, not only keeping them running.

Core principles:

- Reliability as a system property
- Automation as operational safety
- Toil reduction as an engineering goal
- Incident response as a repeatable process

Most of what I build is invisible when it works.
