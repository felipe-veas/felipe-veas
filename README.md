Site Reliability Engineer — Platform Reliability & Operations

I run production systems. Most of my day isn't spent fixing broken servers—it's spent fixing how organizations operate them.

Reliability is an operational discipline. My focus is reducing human error, making incident response predictable, and building platforms so teams can ship safely without needing a PhD in operations.

I've spent ~9 years operating distributed systems and critical SaaS environments.

## What I Work On

My work sits at the intersection of SRE, platform engineering, and operational design.

- Incident response and coordination under real production pressure
- Operational safety, deployment strategies, and rollout control
- Driving down operational load (toil) across engineering teams
- Converting tribal knowledge into runbooks and repeatable processes
- Pushing operational boundaries so developers can run their own services safely

Most production failures aren't technology problems—they're flawed operational models.

## Writing & Operational Notes

I maintain repositories documenting practical reliability engineering. These aren't step-by-step tutorials. They're notes on how production actually fails and how teams can run systems without burning out.

### Operating Production Systems
How services behave under real load and why reliability is ultimately an organizational problem.

### Handling Production Incidents
Incident response, coordination, severity assessments, and decision-making when things are actively on fire.

### Reducing Operational Toil
Runbooks, automation boundaries, and keeping on-call rotations sustainable.

### Platform Engineering Model
Why internal platforms exist and how they shift operational ownership.

### Observability in Production
Alerting philosophy, signal-to-noise ratios, and designing workflows for actual investigations.

## Engineering Work

### Kubernetes Platform (GitOps + Terraform)
A production-style platform demonstrating how to operationally separate infrastructure from workloads so both can be managed safely.

### Operational Tooling

Internal CLI tools built to reduce cognitive load during operations.

## Engineering Approach

I'm focused on changing *how* systems are operated, not just keeping the lights on.

Core tenets:

- Reliability is a property of operations, not just a high-nines uptime metric.
- We automate for safety and consistency, not just convenience.
- Alerts trigger incident response workflows; they aren't just dashboard noise.
- Internal platforms exist to eliminate organizational coordination costs.
- Incident response must rely on process, not hero engineers.

When my work is successful, it's mostly invisible.
