# Felipe Veas

Site Reliability Engineer — Platform Reliability & Operations

**Most reliability problems are organizational, not technical.**

I design and operate production systems with a focus on operational safety, predictable incident response, and reducing operational load across teams.

## What I Actually Run

### Kubernetes Platform (GitOps + Terraform)

Production-style platform showing how infrastructure and workloads can be operated safely and independently.

#### Key properties

- App-of-apps GitOps deployment model (ArgoCD)
- Declarative workload delivery
- Policy enforcement (Kyverno)
- Ingress, certificates, and operational services
- Observability stack (metrics + logs)

#### Operational outcomes

- Reproducible cluster bootstrap
- Safer change management
- Drift detection
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Operational visibility of cluster state

## Operational Tooling

Internal tooling designed to make operational actions safe and repeatable.

### dotctl — operational CLI interface [→ felipe-veas/dotctl](https://github.com/felipe-veas/dotctl)

### homebrew-tap — standardized tool distribution [→ felipe-veas/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/felipe-veas/homebrew-tap)

### Outcomes

- Faster onboarding
- Repeatable operations
- Fewer configuration errors
- Less manual intervention during incidents

## Production Reliability Notes

I maintain repositories documenting how real production systems behave and how teams operate them under pressure.
These are not tutorials — they are operational reliability notes.

## What I Work On

- Incident response and coordination under real production pressure
- Safe deployment and rollout control
- Reducing operational load (toil)
- Converting tribal knowledge into runbooks
- Enabling developers to operate services safely

---

## Operating Philosophy

Production reliability is achieved through safer operational systems, not stronger infrastructure.

### Failures usually come from

- Unclear ownership
- Unsafe change processes
- Alerting that does not guide action
- Poor incident coordination

I design systems where the correct operational action is the easiest action.
